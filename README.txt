This is a simple program I wrote to convert the desired diameter of an aluminium circle to twists of the tightening screws on the aluminium roller itself. I built this program to solve a real world problem for my uncle, as his aluminium roller had no grading on it and he needed to roll a few circles of 600mm inner diameter.

The UI is intentionally limited to keep the program as simple to use as possible for the user (my uncle).
