The .zip file is all you need to download to run this program.

This is a simple program I wrote to convert the desired diameter of an aluminium circle to twists of the tightening screws on a specific aluminium roller. I built this program to solve a real world problem for my uncle, as his aluminium roller had no grading on it and he needed to roll a few circles of 600mm inner diameter.

The UI is intentionally limited to keep the program as simple to use as possible for the user (my uncle).

The Widget and Slider tabs are unnecessarily complex as they are borrowed from a previous program which had more advanced UI.

This is an intentionally low effort program with ambiguous variable names and no comments, simply because I made the program as quickly as possible so my uncle could use it for a project he was working on at the time.
